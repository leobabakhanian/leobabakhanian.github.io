            Hi, my name is Leo. I am 23-year-old Armenian-American developer and
            I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. From an early age, I
            have always been passionate about technology and I became obssessed
            with programming during high school. I began with modding my video
            games on my computer and slowly began learning bits of Java and C++.
            Today, I pour hours of my time daily to learn technologies such as
            React and harden my data structure skills on websites such as
            leetcode.com. As I progress through this journey, I pride myself on
            being able to quickly pick up and adapt to new languages and skills.
