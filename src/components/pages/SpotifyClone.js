            Note: The live version is stripped down in order to not reveal my
            own Spotify access token. In this case it uses a dummy token for
            demonstration purposes.

            This project was done to get myself more familiarized with APIs
            inside of React and to clone something which I use daily. The web
            app uses an authorization token to load in the user's playlists on
            the left and their discover weekly playlist in the main view. The
            play and skip buttons are functional as well.
